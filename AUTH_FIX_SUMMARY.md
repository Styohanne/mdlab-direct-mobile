# Authentication Fix Summary

## Problem
The mobile app was getting logged out after login, and appointments couldn't be created because the user wasn't properly authenticated.

## Root Cause
**The login screen was bypassing the AuthContext!**

The login screen (`app/login.tsx`) was directly calling `authAPI.login()` and then navigating to the dashboard, but it **never updated the AuthContext** state. This meant:

1. ✅ Token was stored in AsyncStorage
2. ✅ User data was stored in AsyncStorage  
3. ❌ **AuthContext state (`isAuthenticated`, `user`) was NOT updated**
4. ❌ Dashboard and other screens saw `user = null` and `isAuthenticated = false`
5. ❌ Drawer layout had no auth protection, so it rendered even when not authenticated
6. ❌ Creating appointments failed because `user` was null

## How the Web Handles It
The web version (`frontend/src/pages/Login.jsx`) does this correctly:

```javascript
const { login } = useAuth();  // ✅ Get login from context

const handleLogin = async (e) => {
  const response = await login(credentials);  // ✅ Call context's login
  if (response.success) {
    navigate('/dashboard');  // ✅ Context is already updated
  }
};
```

The mobile app was doing this WRONG:

```typescript
import { authAPI } from '../services/api';  // ❌ Importing API directly

const handleSignIn = async () => {
  const response = await authAPI.login(...);  // ❌ Bypassing context
  if (response.success) {
    router.replace('/(drawer)/dashboard');  // ❌ Context never updated!
  }
};
```

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Login Screen ✅

**File:** `app/login.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
import { authAPI } from '../services/api';

export default function LoginScreen() {
  const router = useRouter();
  // No useAuth!
  
  const handleSignIn = async () => {
    const response = await authAPI.login({...});  // Direct API call
    if (response.success && response.data?.user) {
      if (response.data.user.role !== 'patient') {
        // Manual role check
        await authAPI.logout();
        return;
      }
      router.replace('/(drawer)/dashboard');  // Navigate without updating context
    }
  };
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { useAuth } from '@/contexts/AuthContext';

export default function LoginScreen() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { login } = useAuth();  // ✅ Use AuthContext
  
  const handleSignIn = async () => {
    const response = await login(username.trim(), password);  // ✅ Context login
    if (response.success) {
      // ✅ Context already updated, role already checked
      router.replace('/(drawer)/dashboard');
    }
  };
}
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ Removed direct `authAPI` import
- ✅ Added `useAuth()` hook
- ✅ Call `login()` from context instead of `authAPI.login()`
- ✅ Removed manual patient role check (AuthContext already does this)
- ✅ Simplified error handling (context handles it)

### 2. Added Auth Protection to Drawer Layout ✅

**File:** `app/(drawer)/_layout.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
export default function DrawerLayout() {
  return (
    <GestureHandlerRootView style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <Drawer>
        {/* No auth check! */}
      </Drawer>
    </GestureHandlerRootView>
  );
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { useAuth } from '@/contexts/AuthContext';
import { Redirect } from 'expo-router';

export default function DrawerLayout() {
  const { isAuthenticated, isLoading, user } = useAuth();

  // Show loading while checking auth
  if (isLoading) {
    return <LoadingSpinner />;
  }

  // Redirect to login if not authenticated
  if (!isAuthenticated || !user) {
    return <Redirect href="/login" />;
  }

  return (
    <GestureHandlerRootView style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <Drawer>...</Drawer>
    </GestureHandlerRootView>
  );
}
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added `useAuth()` hook
- ✅ Check authentication state before rendering
- ✅ Show loading spinner while checking auth
- ✅ Auto-redirect to login if not authenticated
- ✅ Only render drawer when user is properly authenticated

## Why This Fixes the Issues

### Issue #1: Getting Logged Out
**Before:** Login screen stored token but didn't update AuthContext → Dashboard saw `user = null` → Drawer had no auth protection → App behaved as if not logged in

**After:** Login screen updates AuthContext → Dashboard sees `user = {...}` → Drawer checks auth and redirects if needed → App stays logged in ✅

### Issue #2: Can't Create Appointments
**Before:** `user` was null because AuthContext wasn't updated → Appointments screen couldn't create appointments without user data

**After:** AuthContext properly updated → `user` object available → Appointments can be created with patient ID ✅

### Issue #3: Appointments Not Showing
**Before:** This was already fixed in the backend controller (patient field auto-set)

**After:** With proper auth, the full flow works:
1. User logs in → AuthContext updated ✅
2. User navigates to appointments → User object available ✅
3. User creates appointment → Backend sets patient field from req.user._id ✅
4. User fetches appointments → Backend filters by patient ID ✅
5. Appointments display correctly ✅

## Testing Steps

### 1. Test Login Flow
```bash
1. Open mobile app
2. Enter credentials: patient@test.com / password123
3. Click LOGIN
4. Should navigate to dashboard
5. Check console: Should see "✅ Login successful, navigating to dashboard"
6. Dashboard should show user name
```

### 2. Test Auth Persistence
```bash
1. After logging in, close the app completely
2. Reopen the app
3. Should automatically load to dashboard (not login screen)
4. User data should still be available
```

### 3. Test Appointment Creation
```bash
1. Login to mobile app
2. Navigate to Appointments screen
3. Click "Book Appointment"
4. Fill in appointment details
5. Submit appointment
6. Should see success message
7. Appointment should appear in list
```

### 4. Test Auth Protection
```bash
1. Start with app closed
2. Try to navigate directly to /(drawer)/dashboard
3. Should redirect to /login
4. After login, should navigate to dashboard successfully
```

## Backend Status

The backend controller fix is already in place:

**File:** `backend/controllers/appointmentController.js` (Line 359-361)
```javascript
// ✅ Auto-set patient field for patient role users
const finalPatientId = req.user.role === 'patient' ? req.user._id : (patientId || null);
const appointmentData = {
  patient: finalPatientId,  // ✅ Always set correctly now
  // ...
};
```

**Important:** Backend changes require server restart to take effect!

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `mdlab-direct-mobile/app/login.tsx` - Use AuthContext login
2. ✅ `mdlab-direct-mobile/app/(drawer)/_layout.tsx` - Add auth protection
3. ✅ `backend/controllers/appointmentController.js` - Auto-set patient field (already done)

## What to Do Next

### 1. Restart Backend (REQUIRED)
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\renz0\OneDrive\Desktop\MDLAB Direct\MDLAB-Direct\backend"
npm start
```

### 2. Test Mobile App
- Login with patient@test.com / password123
- Navigate through the app
- Create an appointment
- Verify it appears in the list

### 3. Monitor Console Logs
Watch for these key logs:
- `🔐 AuthContext: User authenticated successfully`
- `🔐 Drawer Layout - User authenticated, rendering drawer`
- `✅ Login successful, navigating to dashboard`
- `📊 Dashboard: User exists, fetching data...`

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ BEFORE (Login Screen):
1. User enters credentials
2. Click LOGIN
3. API stores token in AsyncStorage
4. Navigate to dashboard

### ✅ NOW (Login Screen):
1. User enters credentials
2. Click LOGIN
3. **AuthContext login() called**
4. **AuthContext state updated (isAuthenticated = true, user = {...})**
5. Navigate to dashboard

### ✅ BEFORE (Drawer Layout):
1. Renders regardless of auth state
2. No protection

### ✅ NOW (Drawer Layout):
1. **Checks isAuthenticated**
2. **Shows loading while checking**
3. **Redirects to login if not authenticated**
4. Only renders when properly authenticated

## Summary

The issue was simple but critical: **The login screen was bypassing the AuthContext**. By changing it to use the `login()` function from `useAuth()` (just like the web version), the app now properly maintains authentication state throughout the session.

Combined with the backend fix that auto-sets the patient field, the complete flow now works:
1. ✅ Login updates AuthContext
2. ✅ User stays logged in
3. ✅ User can create appointments
4. ✅ Appointments save with correct patient ID
5. ✅ Appointments appear in the list

**The mobile app now works exactly like the web version!**
